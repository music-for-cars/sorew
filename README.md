# sorew
Discord release bot

Currently the bot responds to the following text commands:

!list - list all SC usernames and latest found tracks
!follow [username] - start following a user
!unfollow [username] - stop following a user

Once following a user, sorew periodically looks at the tracks page of that user and if a new track has been deteced, the new track is posted to the #releases discord channel
